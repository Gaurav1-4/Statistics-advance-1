        "- A probability distribution describes all the possible values a random variable can take and the probabilities associated with those values. The expected outcome (or expected value) of a random variable is a summary statistic that tells us the long-run average result we would expect if we repeated the random process many times.\n",
        "- The relationship is that the expected value is calculated directly from the probability distribution. It is a weighted average of all possible values of the random variable, where the weights are their corresponding probabilities."
